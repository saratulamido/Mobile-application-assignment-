the first most used widget on flutter and sample code
The first most used widget in Flutter is the `MaterialApp` widget. It is the top-level widget for a Flutter application and is used to define the app's theme, title, and home page.

Sample code:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My First Flutter App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My First Flutter App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello, World!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code:

- `MaterialApp` is the top-level widget that wraps the entire app.
- `MyHomePage` is the home page of the app, which is a `StatelessWidget`.
- `Scaffold` is a widget that provides a basic material design layout structure.
- `AppBar` is a widget that displays a material design app bar.
- `Text` is a widget that displays text.

This code creates a basic Flutter app with a material design theme, an app bar, and a home page that displays "Hello, World!".
Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and new widgets are being added to Flutter with each release. Additionally, developers can also create custom widgets by combining existing widgets or creating their own from scratch.
